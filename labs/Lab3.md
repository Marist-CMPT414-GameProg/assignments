# Lab Activity \#3 -- Defining with C++ Classes

## Goals
Practice writing creating and manipulating sprites C++ with SFML.

## Instructions
For this Lab, we're going to refactor our Lab 2 program to use a custom defined C++ class for the Bee object.

1. __Lab Project__. In Visual Studio, "Open" your _GameProg1_ Solution and expand your "Lab2" Project. (In CLion or other IDE, just directly open your Lab2 Project.)
2. __Header file__. Add a New C++ Header File to your project, and write a small C++ class definition that encapsulations the `beeSprite` as well as the `beeAngle` and `beeSpeed` variables (or whatever your called them).
    - Next, re-build your program to ensure that the main source file still compile and links correctly with the Bee.cpp file.
    - Test your program to make sure everything runs as expected.
3. __Using your class__. Modify your main function to use your new class instead of the original, separate variables.
4. __Implementation file__. Add a New C++ Source File to your project and move your method implementations from the header into this new file.
    - Next, re-build your program to ensure that the main source file still compile and links correctly with the Bee.cpp file.
    - Test your program to make sure everything runs as expected.

# Deliverables
To receive full credit for this Lab activity:

- You must have a named Git repository under our class GitHub organization.
- That repository must contain a folder for your `Lab2` project.
- Your `Lab2` folder must contain both your source code and the necessary project configuration.
- Your code must compile and run successfully, and the program satisfy the requirements above.
- You must have a least two separate commits!
